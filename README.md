# Trillo

Trillo project is **one** of the three projects built on design made by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Trillo is all-in-one booking app for family/solo holiday with ability to book all you need on the vacation. Hotel, airline, rent a car and tours are available to book/rent. All in all, user can do everything in this app.

This project is done by using flexbox.

In the next sections I will be breaking down the things that have been shown in separate project sections, starting from general project settings until writing media queries for responsive design.
